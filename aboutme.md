I am a neuroscientist turned deep learning scientist who enjoys everything artistic, adventurous and futuristic. I am working on the important mission of making autonomous vehicles so that we can move onto automating other stuff. Once everything has gone according to plan, we should be able to take Starship to and from Mars and other planets or stars and go explore the universe.
